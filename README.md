# DequeImplementations

A Deque is a doubly-ended Queue which supports adding and/or removing elements from both ends.

The Deque Interface is implemented by an Array-based Deque, a linked list-based Deque, and a circularly linked list-based Deque.

The linked list-based Deques support swapping two nodes at the front or end, and removing a user-specified number of nodes.

JUNIT tests are included for all three classes.
